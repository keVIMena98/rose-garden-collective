To fix the close icon behavior (preventing it from moving with the menu) and smoothen the animation, I need to:

1.  Modify `Header.tsx` to keep the menu button stationary and visible above the sliding menu.
2.  Update `MenuToggle.tsx` to slow down the click animation.

Shall I proceed with updating both files?
